# Weather-Information
This Python script fetches and displays current weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Enter the name of the city when prompted. The script will fetch the current weather data and display the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, feels-like temperature, humidity, wind speed, general weather description, sunrise time, and sunset time for the given city.
The script uses the requests library to make API requests to OpenWeatherMap. The response is then parsed to extract relevant weather information, which is then displayed in a user-friendly format.
